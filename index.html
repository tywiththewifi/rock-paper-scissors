// Create a function named getComputerChoice that will randomly return 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.
// Write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors that takes two parameters: the playerSelection and computerSelection
// Then return a string that declares the winner or tie of the round like so: "You lose! Paper beats rock"
// Write new function called playGame() 
// Use the previous function inside of this one to play a five round game that keeps score and reports a winner/loser at the end
